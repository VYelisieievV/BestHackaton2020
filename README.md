Here we store our Power Rangers team solutions for BEST INT20H Hackaton.

## Test Task:
Our team results can be found here at repository at Test Task directory. Also we provide links to original Kaggle Kernels with identical content.
 * nach-otvet-bestu.ipynb - ***Our final notebook created for review***. Contains our approaches, final socre achieved and our thoughts on model improvments. Also we described what were the problems and gave feedback on task organization.
 * Train Unet MobileNet.ipynb - ***Notebook with all technical DL part***. Basicly where the model was trained and developed. 
 * BEST TwoHead Unet.ipynb - ***Not finished model notebook*** (actually still training). Haven't made it to our final solution, but was mentioned in it as possible improvement.
